# AES-encryption-Python

AES is a widely-used symmetric encryption algorithm that is considered to be very secure. It was originally adopted by the US government and is now used worldwide.

In Python, we used the pycrypto library to encrypt and decrypt data using AES. In this repository we encrypted and decrypted files and strings.
